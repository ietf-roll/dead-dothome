1.  Introduction

   [RFC7788] was published without sufficient DNS review.  It
   incorrectly appears to reserve the ".home" TLD.

2.  Update

   Section 8 of [RFC7788] incorrectly states that ".home" is the default
   Network-Wide zone to be used with generated names.

   Section 8 is to updated to indicate that there is no default.
   Implementations MUST NOT use ".home" as the default, and SHOULD
   configure no implementation default Network-Wide Zone.  An
   implementation with no value SHOULD accept a value from another node.

   Implementations MAY default to a value which the implementator has
   authority over via an ICANN delegated TLD, such as
   "homenet.example.com".

   Implementations MUST provide a mechansim for an end user to re-
   configure the default.

   On CPE edge routers, implementations SHOULD provide a mechanism for
   an operator to configure the default as part of the normal
   provisioning process (such as via TR-69).  The end-user configured
   default MUST take priority.

3.  Security Considerations

   None.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.
